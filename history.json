The call connected Walter S. Gifford, president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), with Sir Evelyn Murray, secretary of the British General Post Office. Unlike earlier transatlantic communication, which relied on undersea telegraph cables transmitting Morse code, this call transmitted human speech in real time.\n\nThe communication relied on shortwave radio signals rather than physical cables. AT&T engineers transmitted the signal from the Rocky Point radio station in New York, while it was received in the United Kingdom using advanced radio receivers. Prior to this achievement, long-distance voice transmission had been hindered by signal loss, distortion, and atmospheric interference. Years of experimentation in radio amplification and frequency control were required to make the call intelligible.\n\nAlthough the service was initially expensive and limited to government and commercial users, it demonstrated that intercontinental voice communication was technically viable. This achievement influenced later developments such as transatlantic coaxial cables, communication satellites, and ultimately fiber-optic networks, forming the foundation of modern global telecommunications.",

Due to slow transatlantic communication, neither side was aware that peace negotiations had concluded.\n\nAmerican forces, composed largely of regular soldiers, militia, free African American units, Native American allies, and privateers, defended fortified positions south of New Orleans. The British army launched a frontal assault but suffered heavy casualties due to strong American defensive preparations and accurate artillery fire. British losses exceeded 2,000 casualties, while American losses were fewer than 100.\n\nDespite having no impact on the final terms of the war, the battle had significant political consequences. It elevated Andrew Jackson to national hero status and strengthened American confidence and nationalism.
